          <h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
          <div>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</div>

          COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</div>
          
          <p>We market to and collect information from children under 13.</p>
          
          <h4>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</h4>
          <div>No</div>
          
          <h4>In order to remove your child’s information please contact the following personnel:</h4>
          <div>Andrés Caraballo</div>
          <div>andres@andrescaraballo.com</div>
          
          <h4>We adhere to the following COPPA tenants:</h4>
          <div>• We will not require a child to disclose more infomration than is reasonably necessary to particapate in an activity.</div>
          <div>• Parents can review their child’s personal information, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information.</div>
          <div>• Parents can agree to the collection and use of their child’s information, but still not allow disclosure to third-parties unless that’s part of the service.</div>
          <div>• Parents can review, delete, manage or refuse with whom their child’s information is shared through through emailing our support staff, by mailing us a letter contacting us directly.</div>
          <div>• We will notify parents directly before collecting PII from their kids. This includes what specific information you will want to collect and how it might be disclosed, a link to your online privacy policy, and how the parents can give their consent. Also, if the parent doesn’t consent within a reasonable time, you will delete the parent’s and child’s online contact info from your records.</div>
          <div>• Parents can give consent by sign a consent form and send it back to you via fax, mail, or electronic scan or contacting us directly.</div>
          <h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
          
          <h4>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h4>
          
          <div>We will notify you via email</div>
          <div>• Within 7 business days</div>
          <div>We will notify the users via in-site notification</div>
          <div>• Within 1 business day</div>
          <div>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</div>
          <h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4>
          <div>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</div>
